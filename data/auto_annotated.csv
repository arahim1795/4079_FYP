rival launch well drug
but factor look help improve chance choose biotech stock likely succeed next 10 year
look company's lead pipeline candidate well early-stage long-shot candidate
look market potential indication pipeline drug target
evaluate risk company face
top three pick
Vertex Pharmaceuticals

company dominate cystic fibrosis market four FDA-approve drug
sale couple drug -- Orkambi Symdeko --
sure increase significantly next year
thanks reimbursement deal recently sign important european market
Vertex's new cf drug Trikafta not european regulatory approval yet but think really safe bet will

no potential rival even close far along Vertex be
say Vertex clear path strong revenue earning growth -- base CF franchise alone
fully expect Vertex also drug market within next decade treat disease cf
company's pipeline include experimental drug target pain several rare genetic disease
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency apol1 mediate kidney disease
Vertex work CRISPR Therapeutics develop gene-editing therapy target rare blood disease beta-thalassemia sickle cell disease

edita license right edit-101
Allergan small biotech not make revenue gene-editing therapy may generate eventually approve
but edita ' chip not ride edit-101
Editas Allergan take similar approach edit-102 treat another genetic eye disease Usher syndrome type 2a take edit-101
like Vertex CRISPR Therapeutics Editas also develop CRISPR gene-editing therapy target beta-thalassemia sickle cell disease
edita hope file FDA approval later year begin clinical testing therapy
company's approach editing HBG1 HBG2 gene could more effective CRISPR Therapeutics ' approach editing bcl11ae gene
rationale choose edita though CRISPR gene-editing platform hold promise treat wide range disease

put aside grow pain marijuana industry encounter past year still expect one fastest-grow industry planet next decade
though estimate board Wall Street look annual weed sale catapult $ 109 billion 2018 $ 50 billion $ 200 billion worldwide annual basis 2030
north american pot company aggressively expand capacity investor pile marijuana stock year
however not growth marijuana space necessarily same
statistic show certain demographic cannabis company go want pay especially close attention to
fact one marijuana-use statistic stand head shoulder above rest
one cannabis-use statistic nee know
July 2019 Gallup release late breakdown regard percentage Americans smoke marijuana
consider record-tie 66 % Americans want see marijuana legalize United States project large cannabis market world annual sale datum contain within national survey invaluable weed-base company
though confidential national usage rate remain fairly steady 2015 2019 ( 12 % 2019 ) age breakdown usage statistic cannabis ceo really eye
break down age 2019 marijuana-use rate United States follow :
age 18 29 : 22 %
age 30 49 : 11 %
age 50 64 : 12 %
age 65
+ : 3 %
one hand no surprise old Americans less likely regular cannabis user
senior historically more adverse view cannabis young adult datum provide even more evidence fact
but really stand many young adult regularly use marijuana
base survey young adult pretty much twice likely millennial
Gen X late-bear boomer use cannabis product
not only mean young adult future would-be focus marijuana industry but important note young adult also considerably more likely use high-margin derivative edible vape infuse beverage old adult
make young consumer important cog future profitability cannabis stock
investor want know three derivative-focus marijuana stock
no doubt every single marijuana stock throughout North America focus produce number high-margin derivative target burgeon young base consumer trio name want follow especially closely come derivative production
view basically no-brainer consider extraction-service company MediPharm Labs Valens Company Neptune Wellness Solutions
company take cannabis hemp biomass process yield resin distillate concentrate target cannabinoid use production high-margin derivative
not mention extraction-service company may also offer white-label service production thereby reach consumer more direct basis
Medipharm Labs Valens solely focus canadian market show similar marijuana-use rate among young adult
MediPharm ultimately 500000 kilo peak annual processing capacity Valens aim 1 million kilo per year run-rate basis
thing be company begin process hemp cannabis biomass little year ago but already generate no-nonsense profit quarterly basis without aid one-time benefit
want more United States-focus processor Neptune Wellness Solutions would well choice
acquisition SugarLeaf 2019 Neptune boost peak annual run-rate processing capacity 200000 kilo 15 million kilo
SugarLeaf's 24000-square-foot facility North Carolina long-term boon Neptune
grower provide more direct investment opportunity cannabis space extraction company heart derivative movement -- movement speak loud young adult
yes short-term risk associate derivative pot product
one hand little doubt derivative go represent major growth driver north american cannabis company long run young consumer future cannabis industry
but not mean not risk short term
Canada supply issue have continue be persistent problem
since traditional cannabis flower sale commence neighbor north Oct 17 2018 supply shortage
and/or bottleneck ongoing
supply problem especially notable Ontario country's most-populous province
initially operate retail license lottery system Ontario only open 24 dispensary Oct 17 2019 one-year anniversary recreational weed sale
approximately one store per 604000 people far too province size
even change place before sufficient retail channel place throughout Ontario reach consumer
meanwhile United States high tax rate select recreationally legal state make virtually impossible legal producer compete black-market product
example California large marijuana market world annual sale see cannabis revenue decline $ 500 million 2018 year
adult-use weed sale commence
since derivative sport even high price point traditional dry flower gap price black-market product even more pronounced
resolution issue north american cannabis industry contend with go take time fix take shape
mean patience need investor marijuana company work early stage grow pain
none Cronos Group pot stock shiny surge last year
may hard believe Cronos Group big all-time winner among canadian marijuana stock especially view last 12 month
Cronos lose nearly two-third market cap since February 2019
even steep decline though Cronos outperform rival long run
brace staggering sum
look back
before get amount money after buy Cronos stock first important note canadian cannabis producer two different initial listing major stock exchange
United States investor probably more familiar Cronos ' list Nasdaq stock exchange February 2018
however Cronos stock available trading before Canada
July 2014 PharmaCan conduct IPO TSX Venture Exchange initial share price 010 canadian dollar time roughly us$ 0093 per share
PharmaCan change name Cronos Group October 2016
buy $ 1000 worth share would later become Cronos Group 2014 ipo price would able scoop up 10752 share
do initial investment would worth $ 78920
legendary investor Peter Lynch use get excited talk 10-baggers reference stock multiply initial investment tenfold
Cronos more
near-79-bagger
time everything
turn $ 1000 nearly $ 79000 massive achievement
make sure sit down
sell Cronos day after Altria announcement make Dec 7 2018 would increase initial investment $ 136765
somehow sense time right instead sell Cronos ' peak March 5 2019
would amass fortune $ 254822 -- again off initial investment only $ 1000
sound great
suppose miss Cronos ' initial canadian IPO but opt buy stock
story not great
instead huge five-figure six-figure gain sit loss buy Cronos Nasdaq debut
stock down close 4 % since then
time everything least come invest marijuana stock
more relevant question much money could make invest Cronos Group much money may make buying stock now
suspect future fortune hinge timing case too
however time not refer buy but instead long plan hold share Cronos
good guess Cronos many canadian marijuana stock could rebound 2020
industry dynamic improve launch Cannabis 20 cannabis derivative market Canada Ontario issue more license new retail cannabis store
Cronos could also benefit growth United States hemp CBD market year
no might but company also face significant challenge -- especially fact still lose boatload money every quarter
however long term ( and talk five year more ) global cannabis market expand significantly
Cronos ' relationship Altria give stay power most peer not have
not expect $ 1000 invest Cronos
today turn close $ 79000 within next year
but think stock could deliver solid return patient investor willing endure lot volatility
tend lump Aurora Cannabis Canopy Growth together top-tier player canadian cannabis industry
extent group right
Aurora Canopy lead industry production capacity
claim high market share canadian adult-use recreational marijuana market
but point forward not place Aurora Canopy top tier among canadian cannabis producer
two company report late quarterly result last week
abundantly clear Canopy Growth different league Aurora
yes Aurora report dismal fiscal 2020 Q2 result Canopy Growth announce fiscal 2020 Q3 result much better expect
but difference update go beyond number
Aurora excuse
canopy produce result
probably good example relate quarter-over-quarter revenue comparison
Aurora's net revenue plunge 26 % sequentially
Most decline relate company's big adjustment product return price adjustment
but Aurora also attribute poor performance part industrywide impact slow pace retail store licensing
Contrast Canopy Growth say 62 % quarter-over-quarter jump net revenue
company single open 140 new store fiscal third quarter key factor behind solid sale growth adult-use recreational market
keep mind Aurora Canopy compete market
company face headwind
however Canopy appear navigate headwind more effectively Aurora be
one reason Aurora Cannabis ' q2 revenue lower stem big mistake make company
December Aurora announce german authority temporarily suspend license sell medical cannabis country
Problem Aurora use radiation kill microbe cannabis plant without first obtain necessary permit market irradiate cannabis product
embarrassing glitch cost company
32 million canadian dollar ( around us$ 24 million ) second quarter
Canopy Growth capitalize Aurora's blunder
state
medical cannabis sale Germany higher expect
due opportunistic sale german market fill
supply gap result regulatory enforce sale halt cannabis product offer another vendor
Aurora's pain Canopy's gain
meanwhile Canopy's strategic acquisition pay off company
german cannabinoid company c3 german vaporizer manufacturer Storz & Bickel british skincare sleep solution company work canadian sport nutrition company BioSteel buy Canopy past year -- contribute organic growth big cannabis producer
big differentiator Canopy Growth Aurora Cannabis not new one
canopy already big partner alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands
Aurora still only hope land major partner
gap show up big-time Aurora's Canopy's balance sheet quarterly update
Aurora report cash cash equivalent ca$1563 million Dec 31 2019
Canopy's cash stockpile total ca$227 billion include cash cash equivalent marketable security
hard overstate big advantage relationship Constellation give Canopy
huge amount cash
obviously important plus
but Canopy also access Constellation's distribution network United States marketing hemp-base CBD product
Aurora not even presence United States CBD market yet
sure Aurora could find partner
however not single reference company's effort Q2 conference call
probably close thing brief comment interim CEO Executive Chairman Michael Singer Aurora likely look new CEO experience consumer package good industry
course Canopy already new CEO CPG experience former Constellation Brands CFO David Klein lead company
absolutely could rebound Germany
could achieve success Cannabis 20 market
could find fantastic new ceo
and yes Aurora could even land big partner point
however Canopy still claim top market share Canada
revenue grow
bottom line improve
company management team place appear highly competent inspire shareholder ' confidence
Aurora not make claim yet
like not several tier canadian marijuana stock
reality Canopy Growth top tier right now but Aurora not
forget Canada United States big story come cannabis
one thing United States cannabis market
much big Canada's
also more opportunity growth additional state legalize cannabis prospect federal regulatory change would benefit cannabis industry
look stock buy capitalize United States cannabis opportunity Charlotte's Web Holdings Green Thumb Industries radar screen
case Charlotte's Web holding
technically Charlotte's web hemp stock rather marijuana stock
distinction worth note since hemp legal federal level United States but marijuana not
however Charlotte's web categorize marijuana stock hemp first cousin marijuana difference two level thc cannabis plant
Charlotte's web single-handedly launch United States hemp CBD market several year ago
leader hemp CBD industry claim no 1 brand total hemp CBD market
company deliver strong growth
revenue soar 42 % year year third quarter
Charlotte's web also demonstrate consistent profitability most part although post small loss q3 due high operating expense
more importantly though Charlotte's web's growth could accelerate future
company's product shelf 9000 retail location more double number begin 2019
hemp legalize United States December 2018 hemp CBD market still only early innings
perhaps big potential catalyst Charlotte's web possibility federal regulation could change allow use CBD dietary supplement
although United States Food Drug Administration take hard line against CBD dietary supplement legislation introduce United States House Representatives bypass FDA revise federal law
too soon know bill become law but reason cautiously optimistic
encourage Charlotte's web step up game government relation recently hire Kelly Shea newly create position senior vice president government affairs & corporate communication
case Green thumb Industries
Green Thumb Industries rank one large multistate cannabis operator United States company
vertically integrated operating cultivation manufacturing facility marketing cannabis brand wholesale channel run retail cannabis store
growth story Green Thumb phenomenal
company's revenue soar 296 % year year third quarter 2019 jump 52 % quarter quarter
Green Thumb also deliver positive adjusted earning before interest taxis depreciation amortization
growth drive large part Green Thumb's retail expansion
early 2019 company operate 14 retail cannabis store
recently open 41st store
plenty room
Green Thumb continue grow
company hold 55 additional license open even more retail cannabis store
far Green Thumb operation 12 state
state include California home big recreational marijuana market Florida home large medical cannabis market
Green Thumb also enjoy strong growth home state Illinois recently launch recreational marijuana market
remember too Green Thumb achieve success marijuana remain illegal federal level United States federal law change -- presidential executive order issue legalize marijuana across United States democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders want -- Green Thumb Industries could even great growth prospect
well marijuana stock
fan Charlotte's web past
however FDA's stance against allow CBD dietary supplement raise concern Charlotte's web's prospect could less hope
think good chance
United States Congress could sidestep FDA but not slam dunk
view green thumb clear path success point
although company not profitable yet think right track deliver consistent profit
opinion could change hemp CBD officially approve dietary supplement but meantime think Green Thumb Industries better pick
