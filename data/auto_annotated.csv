put aside grow pain marijuana industry encounter past year still expect one fastest-grow industry planet next decade,1
though estimate board Wall Street look annual weed sale catapult $10.9 billion 2018 $50 billion $200 billion worldwide annual basis 2030,1
north american pot company aggressively expand capacity investor pile marijuana stock year,2
however not growth marijuana space necessarily same,2
statistic show certain demographic cannabis company go want pay especially close attention to,2
fact one marijuana-use statistic stand head shoulder above rest,2
one cannabis-use statistic nee know,2
July 2019 Gallup release late breakdown regard percentage Americans smoke marijuana,2
consider record-tie 66% Americans want see marijuana legalize United States project large cannabis market world annual sale datum contain within national survey invaluable weed-base company,2
though confidential national usage rate remain fairly steady 2015 2019 (12% 2019) age breakdown usage statistic cannabis ceo really eye,2
break down age 2019 marijuana-use rate United States follow,2
age 18 29: 22%,2
age 30 49: 11%,2
age 50 64: 12%,2
age 65,2
+: 3%,2
one hand no surprise old Americans less likely regular cannabis user,2
senior historically more adverse view cannabis young adult datum provide even more evidence fact,2
but really stand many young adult regularly use marijuana,2
base survey young adult pretty much twice likely millennial,2
Gen X late-bear boomer use cannabis product,2
not only mean young adult future would-be focus marijuana industry but important note young adult also considerably more likely use high-margin derivative edible vape infuse beverage old adult,2
make young consumer important cog future profitability cannabis stock,2
investor want know three derivative-focus marijuana stock,2
no doubt every single marijuana stock throughout North America focus produce number high-margin derivative target burgeon young base consumer trio name want follow especially closely come derivative production,2
view basically no-brainer consider extraction-service company MediPharm Labs Valens Company Neptune Wellness Solutions,2
company take cannabis hemp biomass process yield resin distillate concentrate target cannabinoid use production high-margin derivative,2
not mention extraction-service company may also offer white-label service production thereby reach consumer more direct basis,2
Medipharm Labs Valens solely focus canadian market show similar marijuana-use rate among young adult,2
MediPharm ultimately 500000 kilo peak annual processing capacity Valens aim 1 million kilo per year run-rate basis,2
thing be company begin process hemp cannabis biomass little year ago but already generate no-nonsense profit quarterly basis without aid one-time benefit,1
want more United States-focus processor Neptune Wellness Solutions would well choice,2
acquisition SugarLeaf 2019 Neptune boost peak annual run-rate processing capacity 200000 kilo 1.5 million kilo,2
SugarLeaf's 24000-square-foot facility North Carolina long-term boon Neptune,2
grower provide more direct investment opportunity cannabis space extraction company heart derivative movement movement speak loud young adult,2
yes short-term risk associate derivative pot product,3
one hand little doubt derivative go represent major growth driver north american cannabis company long run young consumer future cannabis industry,2
but not mean not risk short term,2
Canada supply issue have continue be persistent problem,3
since traditional cannabis flower sale commence neighbor north October 17 2018 supply shortage,3
and/or bottleneck ongoing,3
supply problem especially notable Ontario country's most-populous province,3
initially operate retail license lottery system Ontario only open 24 dispensary October 17 2019 one-year anniversary recreational weed sale,2
approximately one store per 604000 people far too province size,2
even change place before sufficient retail channel place throughout Ontario reach consumer,2
meanwhile United States high tax rate select recreationally legal state make virtually impossible legal producer compete black-market product,2
example California large marijuana market world annual sale see cannabis revenue decline $500 million 2018 year,3
adult-use weed sale commence,2
since derivative sport even high price point traditional dry flower gap price black-market product even more pronounced,3
resolution issue north american cannabis industry contend with go take time fix take shape,2
mean patience need investor marijuana company work early stage grow pain,2
none Cronos Group pot stock shiny surge last year,1
may hard believe Cronos Group big all-time winner among canadian marijuana stock especially view last 12 month,1
Cronos lose nearly two-third market cap since February 2019,3
even steep decline though Cronos outperform rival long run,1
brace staggering sum,2
look back,2
before get amount money after buy Cronos stock first important note canadian cannabis producer two different initial listing major stock exchange,2
United States investor probably more familiar Cronos list Nasdaq stock exchange February 2018,2
however Cronos stock available trading before Canada,2
July 2014 PharmaCan conduct IPO TSX Venture Exchange initial share price 0.10 canadian dollar time roughly $0.093 per share,2
PharmaCan change name Cronos Group October 2016,2
buy $1000 worth share would later become Cronos Group 2014 ipo price would able scoop up 10752 share,2
do initial investment would worth $78920,2
legendary investor Peter Lynch use get excited talk 10-baggers reference stock multiply initial investment tenfold,1
Cronos more,2
near-79-bagger,2
time everything,2
turn $1000 nearly $79000 massive achievement,1
make sure sit down,2
sell Cronos day after Altria announcement make December 7 2018 would increase initial investment $136765,2
somehow sense time right instead sell Cronos peak March 5 2019,2
would amass fortune $254822 again off initial investment only $1000,2
sound great,1
suppose miss Cronos initial canadian IPO but opt buy stock,2
story not great,3
instead huge five-figure six-figure gain sit loss buy Cronos Nasdaq debut,3
stock down close 4% since then,3
time everything least come invest marijuana stock,2
more relevant question much money could make invest Cronos Group much money may make buying stock now,2
suspect future fortune hinge timing case too,2
however time not refer buy but instead long plan hold share Cronos,2
good guess Cronos many canadian marijuana stock could rebound 2020,2
industry dynamic improve launch Cannabis 2.0 cannabis derivative market Canada Ontario issue more license new retail cannabis store,2
Cronos could also benefit growth United States hemp CBD market year,2
number may but company also face significant challenge especially fact still lose boatload money every quarter,3
however long term (and talk five year more) global cannabis market expand significantly,2
Cronos relationship Altria give stay power most peer not have,1
not expect $1000 invest Cronos,2
today turn close $79000 within next year,2
but think stock could deliver solid return patient investor willing endure lot volatility,1
tend lump Aurora Cannabis Canopy Growth together top-tier player canadian cannabis industry,1
extent group right,2
Aurora Canopy lead industry production capacity,1
claim high market share canadian adult-use recreational marijuana market,1
but point forward not place Aurora Canopy top tier among canadian cannabis producer,2
two company report late quarterly result last week,2
abundantly clear Canopy Growth different league Aurora,2
yes Aurora report dismal fiscal 2020 Q2 result Canopy Growth announce fiscal 2020 Q3 result much better expect,2
but difference update go beyond number,2
Aurora excuse,2
canopy produce result,2
probably good example relate quarter-over-quarter revenue comparison,2
Aurora's net revenue plunge 26% sequentially,3
Most decline relate company's big adjustment product return price adjustment,3
but Aurora also attribute poor performance part industrywide impact slow pace retail store licensing,3
Contrast Canopy Growth say 62% quarter-over-quarter jump net revenue,1
company single open 140 new store fiscal third quarter key factor behind solid sale growth adult-use recreational market,2
keep mind Aurora Canopy compete market,2
company face headwind,1
however Canopy appear navigate headwind more effectively Aurora be,1
one reason Aurora Cannabis q2 revenue lower stem big mistake make company,3
December Aurora announce german authority temporarily suspend license sell medical cannabis country,3
Problem Aurora use radiation kill microbe cannabis plant without first obtain necessary permit market irradiate cannabis product,2
embarrassing glitch cost company,3
3.2 million canadian dollar (around $2.4 million) second quarter,2
Canopy Growth capitalize Aurora's blunder,1
state,2
medical cannabis sale Germany higher expect,1
due opportunistic sale german market fill,1
supply gap result regulatory enforce sale halt cannabis product offer another vendor,2
Aurora's pain Canopy's gain,2
meanwhile Canopy's strategic acquisition pay off company,2
german cannabinoid company c3 german vaporizer manufacturer Storz & Bickel british skincare sleep solution company work canadian sport nutrition company BioSteel buy Canopy past year contribute organic growth big cannabis producer,1
big differentiator Canopy Growth Aurora Cannabis not new one,2
canopy already big partner alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands,1
Aurora still only hope land major partner,3
gap show up big-time Aurora's Canopy's balance sheet quarterly update,2
Aurora report cash cash equivalent $156.3 million December 31 2019,2
Canopy's cash stockpile total $2.27 billion include cash cash equivalent marketable security,2
hard overstate big advantage relationship Constellation give Canopy,1
huge amount cash,1
obviously important plus,2
but Canopy also access Constellation's distribution network United States marketing hemp-base CBD product,1
Aurora not even presence United States CBD market yet,3
sure Aurora could find partner,2
however not single reference company's effort Q2 conference call,2
probably close thing brief comment interim CEO Executive Chairman Michael Singer Aurora likely look new CEO experience consumer package good industry,2
course Canopy already new CEO CPG experience former Constellation Brands CFO David Klein lead company,2
absolutely. could rebound Germany,2
could achieve success Cannabis 2.0 market,2
could find fantastic new ceo,2
and yes Aurora could even land big partner point,2
however Canopy still claim top market share Canada,1
revenue grow,1
bottom line improve,1
company management team place appear highly competent inspire shareholder confidence,1
Aurora not make claim yet,2
like not several tier canadian marijuana stock,2
reality Canopy Growth top tier right now but Aurora not,2
forget Canada United States big story come cannabis,2
one thing United States cannabis market,2
much big Canada's,2
also more opportunity growth additional state legalize cannabis prospect federal regulatory change would benefit cannabis industry,2
look stock buy capitalize United States cannabis opportunity Charlotte's Web Holdings Green Thumb Industries radar screen,2
case Charlotte's Web holding,2
technically Charlotte's web hemp stock rather marijuana stock,2
distinction worth note since hemp legal federal level United States but marijuana not,2
however Charlotte's web categorize marijuana stock hemp first cousin marijuana difference two level thc cannabis plant,2
Charlotte's web single-handedly launch United States hemp CBD market several year ago,2
leader hemp CBD industry claim number 1 brand total hemp CBD market,1
company deliver strong growth,1
revenue soar 42% year year third quarter,1
Charlotte's web also demonstrate consistent profitability most part although post small loss q3 due high operating expense,2
more importantly though Charlotte's web's growth could accelerate future,2
company's product shelf 9000 retail location more double number begin 2019,2
hemp legalize United States December 2018 hemp CBD market still only early innings,2
perhaps big potential catalyst Charlotte's web possibility federal regulation could change allow use CBD dietary supplement,2
although United States Food Drug Administration take hard line against CBD dietary supplement legislation introduce United States House Representatives bypass FDA revise federal law,2
too soon know bill become law but reason cautiously optimistic,2
encourage Charlotte's web step up game government relation recently hire Kelly Shea newly create position senior vice president government affairs & corporate communication,2
case Green thumb Industries,2
Green Thumb Industries rank one large multistate cannabis operator United States company,2
vertically integrated operating cultivation manufacturing facility marketing cannabis brand wholesale channel run retail cannabis store,2
growth story Green Thumb phenomenal,1
company's revenue soar 296% year year third quarter 2019 jump 52% quarter quarter,1
Green Thumb also deliver positive adjusted earning before interest taxis depreciation amortization,1
growth drive large part Green Thumb's retail expansion,2
early 2019 company operate 14 retail cannabis store,2
recently open 41st store,2
plenty room,2
Green Thumb continue grow,1
company hold 55 additional license open even more retail cannabis store,2
far Green Thumb operation 12 state,2
state include California home big recreational marijuana market Florida home large medical cannabis market,2
Green Thumb also enjoy strong growth home state Illinois recently launch recreational marijuana market,1
remember too Green Thumb achieve success marijuana remain illegal federal level United States federal law change presidential executive order issue legalize marijuana across United States democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders want Green Thumb Industries could even great growth prospect,2
well marijuana stock,1
fan Charlotte's web past,2
however FDA's stance against allow CBD dietary supplement raise concern Charlotte's web's prospect could less hope,3
think good chance,1
United States Congress could sidestep FDA but not slam dunk,2
view green thumb clear path success point,1
although company not profitable yet think right track deliver consistent profit,3

Bank N.T. Butterfield & Son report fourth-quarter result February 12 banking another solid quarter,1
earning down fall $3.50 per share 2018 $3.30 2019,3
offshore bank work integrate recent acquisition expand presence Channel Islands off coast,2
France invest expand exist banking presence Cayman Islands,2
despite cost expansion acquisition result change deposit mix affect profitability loan book Butterfield remain highly profitable prospect better one year ago,1
not something readily apparent base stock performance; share down 5% past year off more 37% all-time high 2018,3
decline come even Butterfield's dividend up 38% support almost 42% growth earning past three year,2
investor may eschew Butterfield (good chance never even hear) management continue play long game expand presence key market diversify business,2
no get around,2
Butterfield favorite high-yield bank stock; may even favorite bank stock period,2
keep read learn more excellent,2
under-the-radar bank make especially compelling right now,2
key metric move right direction,2
net interest margin important metric bank stock,2
measure much interest charge keep after pay interest deposit source capital,2
after recent acquisition Channel Islands banking business Dutch ABN AMRO Bank Butterfield see net interest margin fall sharply 3.38% fourth quarter 2018 2.59%,3
however expect change loan deposit mix follow acquisition management's effort integrate new Channel Islands bank operation start pay off,1
net interest margin improve slightly third fourth quarter management say likely continue improve,1
management credit Channel Islands expansion helping boost non-interest income almost 7% quarter largely fee earn various banking service,1
important metric remain strong starting improve,1
Less year since Butterfield spend $208 million acquire ABN AMRO's Channel Islands banking business still not completely clear kind return investor see new asset,2
however see affect Butterfield important metric interim,2
return asset return equity,2
yes metric contract past year largely result recent acquisition but also interest rate decline much debt exposure United States mortgage-back security,1
however Butterfield continue substantially outperform 1% 10% respective benchmark bank aim for,1
moreover expectation see metric trend back upward; net interest margin Butterfield report sequential improvement third quarter fourth quarter 2019,1
under-the-radar buy,1
whether look income growth good value solid margin safety think Butterfield radar,1
profitable metric show expect see earning begin grow near future management get leg fully underneath after last year's expansion Channel Islands,1
dividend yield 5% recent price well protect payout ratio below 40%,1
lastly Butterfield stock cheap,1
share trade 10.3 time 2019 earning,2
20% 30% cheap big United States bank put bluntly Butterfield's return profile significantly better most,1
put together highly profitable bank trading low valuation less profitable peer,1

time Biogen Bristol-Myers Squibb claim similar market cap,2
case spring 2015,2
since then though two drugmaker path diverge dramatically,2
legitimate reason investor would want consider buy Biogen Bristol-Myers Squibb right now,2
Biogen BMS stack up against other,2
case Biogen,2
think three top reason potentially buy Biogen stock,2
sale spinal muscular atrophy drug continue soar jump 16% year year fourth quarter 2019 $543 million,1
worry Novartis sma gene therapy Zolgensma may seriously hurt Spinraza largely subside,1
international market present opportunity sustain sale growth spinraza,2
until recently probably not include Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise strong reason consider stock,1
biotech's MS sale not give investor anything get excited about,2
however Biogen score important victory early month,1
United States Patent Trademark Office's Patent Trial Appeal Board rule against Mylan's challenge Biogen's key patent MS drug Tecfidera,1
Tecfidera be far Biogen's biggest-sell drug,1
PTAB ruling mean Tecfidera likely not generic competition until 2028,2
great news,1
Biogen able count sustain revenue blockbuster MS drug,1
but probably most important reason think invest Biogen biotech's pipeline,2
after near-death experience experimental Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab Biogen shock biopharmaceutical world October announce plan file FDA approval drug base new clinical datum,2
definitely not slam dunk aducanumab win FDA approval,2
do though Biogen almost certainly another future blockbuster lineup,1
Biogen pipeline candidate notably include BIIB067 target rare form amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ischemic stroke drug BIIB093,2
however aducanumab stand Biogen's lottery ticket could pay off huge way,1
case Bristol-Myers Squibb,2
BMS though not point only one drug one franchise Biogen,2
first reason think BMS stock worthy consideration company's entire current lineup,1
market researcher EvaluatePharma crunch number last year predict world's big blockbuster 2024,2
two BMS drug make top five: blood thin Eliquis cancer immunotherapy Opdivo,2
also add arthritis drug Orencia multiple myeloma drug Empliciti list winner BMS lineup,1
thank company's recent acquisition Celgene BMS even more rich,1
blood cancer drug Revlimid rank one most successful drug market,1
Celgene's multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst solid tumor drug Abraxane also make immediate contribution BMS growth,1
however think pipeline Celgene bring table second top reason invest BMS,2
drugmaker could several potential blockbuster destine FDA approval within next year two include MS drug ozanimod (which also potential treat Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis),2
cancer cell therapy liso-cel ide-cel,2
Bms already plenty pipeline program even before Celgene acquisition,2
most promising focus,1
Opdivo Yervoy treat additional type cancer,2
also key reason buy BMS Biogen not claim: great dividend,1
view BMS one more attractive dividend stock market right now dividend yield 2.7%,1
expectation company able boost dividend payout significantly next year current product pipeline deliver robust earning growth,1
better buy,1
Biogen could easily big winner,1
Bristol-Myers Squibb aducanumab win FDA approval,1
however risk high Alzheimer's disease drug could fail secure approval,3
without aducanumab Biogen not nearly attractive,3
Bms egg spread across multiple basket,2
one pipeline setback not devastating,2
think late-stage program BMS pick up Celgene buyout pretty good prospect win regulatory approval become commercial success,2
income investor Bristol-Myers Squibb without question well pick since Biogen not offer dividend,2
even growth investor though think BMS get nod growth potential come low risk level,2
want stock deliver solid total return allow sleep peacefully night view go Bristol-Myers Squibb,1
AO Smith not household name investor but maybe after 26 consecutive year dividend increase,1
average annual dividend increase last decade roughly 11% too solid dividend growth stock,1
only problem industrial company face headwind one most important global market: China,3
thing only get bad,3
stock price down roughly 35% 2018 high,3
supply basic need good business,2
AO Smith not exciting way,3
bread-and-butter product water heater though expand reach similarly boring fare like water air purification,2
thing be people develop market take hot water grant; safe reliable water heater still affordable luxury develop market like China,2
try take cold shower understand anyone afford water heater buy one,2
many year Smith focus two core market: North America China,2
today slow-grow north american market make up around 64% revenue,2
rest come largely China,2
great business,1
long time country spend vast amount money build new home citizen move rural area big city,2
put number that Smith's China business expand annualize rate 19% 2009 2018,1
huge number help explain country important company's financial result future,2
only thing be China not great lately AO Smith,2
trouble China,3
issue start 2018 China's growth begin ebb little,3
not exactly bad year,2
AO Smith revenue rest world segment consist mostly China up around 5%,1
problem earning division flat,3
thing get bad 2019 China's economy start show more serious sign slow,3
last year earning rest world group decline nearly 75%,3
fourth quarter 2019 drop stagger 96% !,3
terrible measure help explain stock fall,2
however company hardly sit idle hope thing get well,2
trim operation rationalize business focus balance operation China underlie demand see,2
Smith report fourth-quarter 2019 earning actually sound relatively upbeat chinese operation expect 2.5% sale jump,1
not exactly scream win would huge improvement 2019's result sale China fall 19% year,2
Q4 2019 conference call CEO Kevin Wheeler comment,2
near term chinese economy remain weak,3
strong premium brand broad product offer key product category broad distribution reputation quality innovation,2
time well position maximize favorable demographic,2
China India enhance shareholder value,2
say first quarter expect weak Lunar New Year holiday,3
after that Smith assume result would start pick up,2
only coronavirus crop up issue steadily grow intensity effectively shut down entire region China,3
AO Smith's conference call basically admit covid-19 outbreak wildcard,2
2020 EPS guidance exclude potential impact business develop coronavirus originate China,2
although clearly too soon tell bad be answer AO Smith's chinese operation 2020 probably perform bad originally expect,3
not good news since company finally get handle business region follow two difficult year,3
save grace here however nearly two-third sale company come,2
develop market slow steady growth rate drive well-wear replacement cycle,2
China could clip earning but not completely derail,2
furthermore company's balance sheet provide firm foundation weather storm,2
put number that Smith's debt-to-equity ratio ultralow 0.05 so,1
cover interest expense incredibly strong 43 time,1
payout ratio 40%,2
payout ratio up recent past earning down 2019 hardly concern figure,1
company clearly deal headwind face,3
another tough year,3
point investor probably expect 2020 rough year,3
AO Smith's rest world segment largely make up chinese operation,2
mean company's forecast 2020 could bit too rosy point may get dial back year progress,2
say lot bad news already price stock,3
2.2% dividend yield not terribly compelling absolute basis high decade,1
dividend growth investor probably take close look company today investor run scared,3
even 2020 another tough year company no trouble survive itand thrive headwind fade away,2

couple noteworthy player market Insulet impress investor analyst alike consistent impressive growth figure,1
insulin pump,2
understand market,2
insulin pump help diabetes patient regulate blood sugar level provide consistent dose insulin throughout day,2
Most diabetes patient not currently use insulin pump but give convenience factor expect many patient begin use year come,2
around 350000 people United States use insulin pump; 320000 type 1 diabetes remainder type 2,2
consider severity type 1 diabetes patient whose pancreas incapable produce insulin make sense majority early adopter pump fall category,2
however type 2 diabetes patient also use pump,2
350000 user may not seem like massive number right now number patient use device expect explode come year,2
2018 global insulin pump market estimate around $4.1 billion but 2025 predict grow $16 billion per year,2
among reason pretty big convenience factor come use pump,2
instead patient inject multiple time per day insulin pump low maintenance job,2
Insulet one three major competitor insulin pump market; two company Medtronic Tandem Diabetes care,2
Insulet know OmniPod system top tubeless insulin pump available right now,2
OmniPod waterproof discreet wear under clothing,2
Tandem diabetes t: slim X2 insulin pump not waterproof require tube much more conspicuous least now OmniPod able distinguish competitor,2

only major player insulin pump market Medtronic much large either Tandem Insulet command market cap,2
however Medtronic's price-to-sale ratio 5.1 substantially cheap either two competitor (although revenue grow much small pace far perfect comparison),1

Ceo Mark Tritton take top job last November admit retailer experience short-term pain effort stabilize business include pressure store traffic trend couple executional challenge,2
Tritton note digital sale grow approximately 20% but growth clearly not offset dismal performance brick-and-mortar store,1
company also state gross margin decline 300 basis point annually due promotion high mix low-margin digital sale,3
percentage revenue sale general administrative (SG&A) expense also rise 390 basis point,1
exclude one-time expense sale-leaseback strategy severance payment layoff SG&A percentage still rise 190 basis point,1
Short Bed Bath & Beyond's revenue decline margin-crush markdown not bring back enough shopper operating expense rise,2
bright red flag indicate Bed Bath & Beyond's meltdown only begin,2
review Bed Bath & Beyond's problem,2
Bed Bath & beyond struggle intense competition,2
Amazon Walmart Target IKEA off-price retailer,2
poor management decision include acquisition root nepotism outsized compensation package,2
former CEO Steven Temares also erode investor confidence company,2
activist investor eventually oust Temares last year company's refresh board hire Tritton former chief merchandising officer Target new CEO,2

Tritton also fire six senior executive include chief merchandising officer chief marketing officer chief digital officer last December,2
investor cheer bold move Bed Bath & Beyond store seemingly gain shopper 7.1% comp growth five-day holiday shopping week Thanksgiving Cyber Monday,2
unfortunately gloomy update fourth quarter indicate shopper not come back after holiday,3
meltdown only start,2
Bed Bath & Beyond still trouble three simple reason,2
first addicted low-margin loss-lead strategy,2
membership program Beyond+ operate loss offer free shipping 20% discount purchase $29 year,2
however program only 1.4 million subscriber pale comparison Amazon's base,2
100 million Prime member United States,2
Tritton may halt Bed Bath & Beyond's outdated coupon strategy but offer across-the-board markdown still crush margin,2
clearly need clear excess inventory make room well product but seem struggle retailer like J.C. Penney make similar promise before,2
second digital margin significantly low in-store margin,2
indicate Bed Bath & Beyond's fulfillment model inefficient overhaul Target Walmart past year could costly,2
Tritton's decision sell real estate $250 million buy time but doubtful pull off aggressive e-commerce expansion before new leasing expense kick erode earning,2
lastly simply not compelling reason shop Bed Bath & Beyond Amazon Walmart Target offer similar product,2
only path forward seem steep markdown but even desperate,2
strategy fail fourth quarter,2
key takeaway,2
not think Bed Bath & Beyond doom yet but fourth-quarter update indicate thing could get much bad near term,2

share gaming headset maker Turtle Beach recently plunge 52-week low after company release preliminary fourth-quarter number,2
expect revenue fall 8%-10% annually quarter,1

analyst expect revenue decline 4% quarter 17% year,1
bottom line Turtle Beach expect EPS decline 44%-52% quarter 82%-85% full year,1
estimate in-line analyst expectation but number ugly fact company meet earning expectation miss revenue estimate suggest cut cost boost earning,1
however CEO Juergen Stark note Turtle Beach face tough year-over-year comparison,2
due extraordinary surge headset sale 2018 revenue decline 2019 anticipate,1
but look ahead Stark expect sale accelerate Microsoft Sony launch new console later year predict gaming headset industry would return growth 2021,2
analyst seem share sentiment average forecast call 4% revenue growth 35% earning growth next year,1
base estimate,2
Turtle Beach trade 11 time forward earning suggest undervalue stock prime rebound,2
rise fall Turtle Beach,2
Turtle Beach's revenue rise 7% 2016 decline 14% 2017 surge whop 93% 2018,1
massive acceleration fuel explosive growth battle royale game like PUBG Fortnite encourage player communicate via headset,2
Turtle Beach launch first wireless gaming headset Xbox one boom start second half 2017 reap reward throughout 2018,2
Turtle Beach become dominant gaming headset maker North America but growth decelerate three reason,2
first growth battle royale game decelerate,2
meanwhile Microsoft Sony Logitech Razer company saturate market similar wireless gaming headset cause Turtle Beach's market share North America dip,2
45.7% 2018 43.4% 2019 accord NPD,2
lastly upgrade cycle gaming headset long gamer generally not need new one unless old one break,2
slowdown prompt Turtle Beach acquire pc accessory maker ROCCAT last June,2
claim acquisition would reduce dependence cyclical headset sale but ROCCAT's core product include gaming keyboard game mice peripheral heavily commoditize,2
strategic shift transform Turtle Beach exciting growth stock small version Logitech also sell diverse portfolio pc console accessory,2
but head-to-head comparison,2
Logitech seem like well investment larger more diversified business less vulnerable competition cyclical downturn,1
believe sale Turtle Beach's headset pick up PS5 Xbox Series X hit market later year stock clearly undervalue,2
unfortunately rosy outlook gloss major headwind,2
Turtle Beach enjoy first mover's advantage back 2017,2
however Sony Microsoft Logitech Razer SADES company since wake up likely launch,2
new wireless gaming headset console pc year,2
battle royale game remain popular but grow slow pace unlikely boost headset sale again,2
Turtle Beach expect ROCCAT boost 2020 revenue least $30 million (13% project sale) accretive earning,1
but realistically ROCCAT could struggle stand crowded market force Turtle Beach ramp up,2
marketing spend throttle earning growth instead,2
short believe investor not put too much faith Turtle Beach's forward valuation,2
instead wait clear full-year outlook report fourth-quarter earning mid-March,2
whether think Alphabet's stock expensive cheap much cheap probably think,2
why: ton cash balance sheet moonshot business bet segment lose billion (but not last forever) several big growth business huge long-term potential but appear barely contribute profit today,1
cash rich balance sheet,1
alphabet enormously cash-rich balance sheet little debt,1
end last year Alphabet,2
$18 billion cash cash equivalent $101 billion marketable security $13 billion non-marketable investment balance sheet,2
almost $133 billion cash investment,2
look company's liability less $5 billion long-term debt book,2
give Alphabet highly profitable generate gobs cash $128 billion net cash clearly excess capital not require operate business,1
therefore investor focus less current stock price more stock price exclude company's net cash investment per share,2
example Alphabet's Class C share trade $1509 per share today but include $187 per share net cash investment,2
mean business  exclude cash really trade closer $1322 per share,2
bet loss not last forever,2
look under hood Alphabet's income statement net income combination huge profit core Google business partially offset big loss moonshot project,1
bet segment,2
example last quarter Google segment make $11 billion operate income bet segment lose $2 billion,2
but important understand distinction,2
Google's operating profit recur nature; fact grow long term,2
bet loss different,2
venture capital-like investment not recur operating loss,2
word business within bet either reach profitability start contribute positively shut down sell,2
management not go tolerate billion loss,2
bet segment forever,2
especially true,2
give CEO's new compensation arrangement tie pay stock price performance next two three year,2
make sense exclude Bets loss consider profitable Alphabet be especially light great discipline management bring bet reduce loss go forward,2
several fast grow business barely chip,2
several Alphabet's fast grow business not appear chip much profit yet,3
mean company's report profit today way low could future,1
consider Google Cloud Platform,2
management not explicitly disclose GCP's profitability but last conference call strongly suggest GCP's current profit margin low perhaps even negative,2
ask whether GCP profitable Amazon's Amazon Web Services size GCP,2

invest aggressively give opportunity try make clear opening comment,2
give opportunity see momentum have accelerate investment go-to-market team,2
talk before set goal triple size sale force,2
also focus building product road map extend global footprint infrastructure,2
words cloud market much more competitive today,3
AWS Microsoft Azure GCP,2
several year ago AWS size GCP today,2
back then AWS essentially market  not worry much competitive pricing pressure therefore high profit margin GCP today,2
plus repeat emphasis GCP's aggressive investment spending clear signal GCP's current profit minimal,2
consider YouTube global leader user-generate video content,2
conference call Porat say continue build subscription service still early day there make sizable investment build out take long-term view here,2
time management team emphasize early day invest code current profit margin low,3
finally consider company's hardware business,2
Porat say invest heavily develop capability hardware engineering well build supply physical distribution chain,2
again mean current profit low,3

internet materially change way customer shop,2
increase number package deliver directly person's home range company sell directly customer,2
surface net win shipper kind but not simple,2
interesting compare XPO Logistics United Parcel Service,2
Ups probably simple two understand,2
although expand various aspect shipping business core quickly deliver individual package,2
this build up massive global organization incredibly efficient collect delivering box,2
also provide less truckload service logistic but combine only 16% company's revenue,2
currently structure XPO Logistics focus supply chain management logistic less truckload service,2
not deliver package exactly like UPS two end up compete other,2
XPO's core customer be basically company,2
UPS's customer bit harder define span corporate individual space end recipient often individual consumer,2
internet competition,2
growth internet shop global commerce hugely beneficial XPO up,2
revenue trend generally high company past decade example,2
competition meanwhile intense since face multiple peer but rise tide lift boat throughout ship space,2
notably XPO historically focus acquisition-lead growth up largely grow via internal investment,2
say key customer become key competitor up XPO,2
Amazon increasingly expand reach shipping reportedly kill relationship XPO 2019 bring logistic effort in-house,2
but Amazon's ambition far large also build ability deliver package individual well reach UPS's space,2
not small issue since Amazon massive force e-commerce long history industry disruptor,2
Ups meanwhile history not able execute particularly well peak delivery season,2
fix this spending heavily upgrade network,2
2020 put roughly $6.5 billion toward effort,2
Amazon key customer one UPS hope continue work with spend important,2
but Amazon's effort deliver package make outlook partnership little uncertain,2
entirely possible Amazon end relationship up like rumor do XPO,2
up relationship sure but lose Amazon would big blow estimate account around 10% up's revenue,2
future,2
thing get little confusing,2
up stick knitting double down upgrade operation future,2
problem Amazon increasingly focus shipping recent Morgan Stanley report suggest Amazon not look deliver ware customer but may consider expand provide delivery service other well,2
up could double down only see 10% business go away and importantly entrance well-finance competitor Amazon,2
complicate up debt-to-equity ratio 6.6 time much high direct competitor FedEx debt-to-equity ratio roughly one time,1
(FedEx way make decision stop work Amazon favor work more closely Amazon's competitor.),2
spend heavily deal already heavily leverage balance sheet not exactly great combination,2
future UPS kind up,2
air right investor well aware  share still 23% below early 2018 high,2
xpo meanwhile decide no longer want grow via acquisition,2
instead intend shrink sell off big part operation,2
remain XPO focus domestic less truckload operation big segment,2
make point highlight division see 150 basis point improvement adjust operating ratio fourth quarter continue trend relatively strong performance,1
say big benefit asset sale likely financial flexibility company's liquidity increase cash sale roll in,1
could allow XPO invest business even jump back acquisition game,2
problem still lot work before XPO slimme down less truckload business,2
fact not sell anything yet,2
XPO's future look interesting but far certain right now,2
takeaway,2
long-term investor need tread caution not to invest legend,2
Warren Buffett like say swing every pitch,2
UPS XPO look like XPO's breakup plan could more interesting approach since company raise cash refocus good division,2
UPS's plan heavy capital spending face,2
leveraged balance sheet increase competition key customer not feel like quite strong path,1
say neither XPO nor up seem like particularly great option,2
most investor today doubly true conservative bent,2
would probably better keep name watch list until little more progress along different path,1

Diller Vice Chairman Peter Kern not mince word earning call,2
comment highlight current assessment Expedia goal OTA,2
organizational complexity,2

lead not only lack long-term strategy but also bloated cost structure aim tame,2
implement new strategy,2
Diller go identify several issue company's current operation,2
change great deal,2
stop too large complexity,2
simplify strategy,2
stop dumb thing start think good thing,2
dumb smart example,2
wasteful activity not core business actually drive sustained growth,2
every brand work silo around world one strategy marketing geography across brand,2
reliance Google Metasearch aggressively move grow direct business loyal relationship customer,2
Expedia dozen brand many direct competition one another,2
part silo problem Diller refer to company would better served brand work concert together serve customer rather operate independently,2
similarly Expedia realize market change rise Google Travel hotel chain even try drive direct business,2
company focus build direct relationship customer encourage brand loyalty app download,2
Diller note company reach 400 million app download among brand increase 40% last year,1
Google's entry market,2
Alphabet's Google send shockwave industry build up travel-booking business much displeasure establish ota like Expedia Booking Holdings,1
Diller say that,2
quite vocal Google certainly monopoly share world monopoly share get do extend business every direction can,2
long not use unfair practice get no problem that,2
but compete against advertiser one large advertiser Booking.com within top five advertiser,2

mean think bad practice,2
Diller also say tell Google's senior management stop take profit away big advertiser,2

after nine straight month high industry gun sale Sturm Ruger finally begin see effect improve market condition report fourth-quarter earning February 20,1
also factor play Ruger's favor period even though quite possible surface revenue earning may not look strong industry statistic would indicate,1
wait demand return,2
Ruger not sell firearm directly public,2
instead sell federally licensed firearm dealer mean layer disconnect firearm production consumer demand,2
see sale rise Ruger need distributor increase inventory level but,2
much 2019 gunmaker methodically reduce inventory,2
combined inventory Ruger's warehouse distributor decrease 18400 unit second quarter 8600 unit third,2
gun manufacturer across industry also hurt bankruptcy United Sporting Companies major firearm distributor bet big outcome 2016 election lose,2
stuck oversupply inventory after gun demand decline after election distributor declare bankruptcy after 85 year business,2
not only make distributor leery take too much product also flood market cheap gun liquidate shelf,2
excess supply market distributor not hurry up order more inventory advance,2
know manufacturer readily ship market necessary,2
Ruger try remain above fray not engage discount bid preserve profit margin,2
hurt short term give up sale market share but make more financially sound company long haul,2
even then margin slip recent period result reduce sale production company say drive unfavorable deleverage fix cost depreciation maintenance indirect labor engineering,1
Sturm Ruger Profit Margins,2

Gross Margin 24.5% 27.1%,2
29.5% Operating Margin 9.7% 13.5% 14.6% Net Margin 7.9% 10.3% 10.0%,2
demand return seem happen Ruger prepare supply distributor firearm term,2
not background check equal,2
nine month improve market condition would suggest demand back while but number one-off event skewed result elevated demand,2
tough new gun control law pass several state pull demand forward other change law result technical increase datum not necessarily mean more gun sell,2
National Shooting Sports Foundation take raw background check data FBI release month parse duplicate background check,2
example state require exist conceal carry permit holder regularly check confirm still eligible permit,2
number show up FBI's number but cull NSSF statistic result more accurate picture market demand,2
Alabama one state change background check law last year result 134% increase check past December,2
adjusted National Instant Criminal Background Check System datum show almost 60000 more check month 4% increase last year but 60% increase result Alabama's new law,1
industry better not necessarily good certain headline number suggest,2
set up future growth,2
since Ruger steadily reduce inventory distributor may enough latent demand help boost gunmaker's sale number but management believe still buyer's market promotional atmosphere effect,2
but head presidential election year could see return panic buying power last sale boom,1
tough new gun control policy,2
consistent topic discussion among various presidential candidate,2
Sturm Ruger protect bottom line amid shift consumer sentiment remain viable gun manufacturer regardless outcome,1
big pharma outstanding space investor past five year,2
fact every single big pharma company outperform broad biopharmaceutical industry period term total return capital include dividend assume dividend reinvestment plan,1
top dog industry crush broad market past-half decade result major structural change internal operation,2
well strong focus develop truly innovative new product cancer rare disease infectious disease,2
Glaxosmithkline Bristol-Myers Squibb forefront industrywide metamorphosis,2
Glaxo process spin off consumer healthcare joint venture Pfizer british pharma giant also place heavy emphasis clinical development cutting-edge cancer drug late,2
Bristol hand recently bulk up acquire top cancer immunology specialist Celgene,2
two big pharma enter new phase respective life cycle arguably perfect time consider stock well long-term prospect,2
case Glaxo,2
Glaxo currently pass period major change,2
pharma titan presently gear up hive off non-core business segment consumer healthcare,2
possibly dermatology business,2
well,2
so Glaxo intend place strong spotlight bevy growth asset respiratory oncology HIV vaccine,2
another key element ongoe metamorphosis drugmaker's renew focus next-generation technology like functional genomic speed up process drug discovery development,2
thus Glaxo slowly but surely move toward become leaner more efficient biopharma-centric company,2
encourage development follow Glaxo's less-than-stellar showing prior decade rather dark period company's history characterize bribery scandal numerous clinical failure inability move invest narrative beyond eventual decline megablockbuster respiratory medicine Advair,2
Pfizer Glaxo yet agree timeline official launch consumer healthcare business standalone unit seminal event take place no later 2024,2
part seismic shift company's underlie business Glaxo plan continue divest certain noncore asset offset cost associate upcome consumer healthcare spinoff presumably assuage regulator United States EU,2
direct consequence spinoff,2
Glaxo seem poise remain fairly dormant merger-and-acquisition scene next year,2
drugmaker may strike more partnering deal similar oncology alliance Merck KGaA but another high-dollar acquisition vein Tesaro buyout probably off table until spinoff complete,2
after all Glaxo probably not take much more debt without severe consequence credit rating,2
company fact currently sport one most highly lever balance sheet among big-pharma peer group,1
turn Glaxo's primary value creator next year probably clinical pipeline,2
fortunately company's r&d engine turn source strength under new leadership team several major regulatory decision oncology HIV respiratory medicine among other slate take place later year,2
heavy reliance experimental-stage asset future growth one major downside however,2
short no realistic way accurately forecast drugmaker's top-line growth next three five year,2
unfortunately Wall Street rarely comfortable high level uncertainity revenue side equation especially come industry megagiant like Glaxo,2
case Bristol,2
Bristol's acquisition biotech heavyweight Celgene prove game-changer company,2
underscore point big pharma's late quarterly result absolutely clobber Wall Street's expectation Celgene's high-growth product portfolio,1
look ahead recent megamerger continue pay dividend big pharma two clear-cut reason,1
first foremost Bristol sport whopping eight blockbuster product after tie-up,1
moreover powerhouse immunotherapy Opdivo no longer bulk heavy lifting growth standpoint,2
key Opdivo's sale start taper off lately,2
fact may never regain status top-tier growth product fierce competition,2
Merck's Keytruda well host immunotherapy,2
second Bristol's clinical pipeline get major injection talent Celgene acquisition,2
near future company expect gain several regulatory approval potential blockbuster like blood disorder treatment Reblozyl well anti-cancer cell therapy,2
bb2121 liso-cel,2
so anything Bristol's growth engine only continue pick up steam year ahead,2
one major drawback associate megamerger,2
Bristol's balance sheet highly levered result deal,2
now big pharma planning reduce debt big way year,2
so though may miss value-create M&A opportunity,2
not end world sure but always,2
good thing flexibility come business development opportunity,2
verdict,2
although company could turn outstanding long-term invest vehicle Bristol's stock stand better pick right now,2
Glaxo's shape-shift endeavor yet take solid form whereas Bristol sit,2
pretty thank decision go big acquire Celgene last year,2
Bristol thus come across low-risk high-reward invest vehicle thing stand now,2

subscriber loss come expect legacy pay-tv space,2
cable satellite subscription less popular consumer every year,2

little simplistic say Netflix stream service kill cable but truth idea,2
legacy pay-tv company not stand pat though,2
DISH Network among legacy pay-tv company enter live-tv streaming space so-call skinny bundle work edge old-school competition slimme-down channel bundle slim price,2
since merger DIRECTV 2015 AT&T make fair share streaming move too,2
AT&T's offering include live-tv streaming service call AT&T TV now direct-to-consumer HBO streaming service call HBO now upcome on-demand service call HBO Max,2
now AT&T move offer most cable-like streaming service market,2
raise question,2
At&t busily rebranding various offering important clarify talk here,2
AT&T replace brand like u-Verse DIRECTV various brand use construction AT&T [ thing ],2
AT&T Internet new u-verse example,2
At&t two similar-sound live-tv brand,2
AT&T tv new name DIRECTV,2
now live-tv streaming service work much way skinny bundle peer like DISH's Sling tv Disney's Hulu + Live tv YouTube tv Alphabet's Google other,2
meanwhile AT&T tv (without now) new pay-tv service position more like cable satellite service but  too stream internet,2
At&t tv process roll select market,2
customer get find deal work much cable contract,2
do,2
promotional rate apply first year service subscriber lock two-year contract,2
contrast AT&T tv rest live-tv streaming set operate month-to-month basis,1
allow customer cancel time no penalty,2
At&t TV also tie device way most live-tv streaming service not,2
AT&T distribute streaming device customer,2
get additional streaming box additional tv cost customer extra. sound familiar pretty much exactly cable box work,2
consumer's perspective bind feel more like legacy pay-tv service skinny-bundle live-tv streaming service,2
technology,2
different legacy pay-tv AT&T tv stream,2
internet instead deliver via traditional cable satellite mean infrastructure but experience essentially same right down be but name cable box,2
high hope AT&T tv,2
flip traditional infrastructure streaming advantage,2
AT&T deliver mobile viewing way deliver at-home experience,2
company could sell new service area lack cable infrastructure wage war fellow phone tv internet company,2
but even positive not help but expose fact cord-cut option only most technical definition,2
yet AT&T seem think service could take off even cable satellite service fail,2
AT&T's fourth-quarter 2019 earning call last month,1
John Stankey president chief operating officer AT&T chief executive officer Warner Media predict AT&T tv will along offering like HBO Max lead year-over-year improvement subscriber loss,2

want tv streaming instead live; migrate streaming offer well deal,2
perk streaming include convenience AT&T tv give AT&T's pay-tv offering but huge part equation remain financial,2
AT&T tv package range $49.99 per month $69.99 per month,1
first year cost more second year contract,2
basic package reportedly cost $93 per month second year high-end package jump $135 per month,1
also $19.95 activation fee monthly fee package regional sport network,2
train travel more comfortable plane travel but plane would not become more popular among consumer,2
airline slap wheel stick track problem like limited legroom lengthy security line lousy food option still intact,2
stream beat legacy pay-tv but not back-end technology consumer neither see nor most part care about,2
AT&T TV appear miss point,2
consumer perspective not much,2
but AT&T see difference,2
speak December's Barclays Global TMT Conference AT&T CEO Jeff McElfresh say,2
excited product think CapEx [ capital expenditure]-light product,2
acquisition cost half legacy satellite product enable,2
content programming lineup every bit good user experience future-lean,2
future-lean user experience pretty vague concept but clear dollar-and-cent argument here too,2
without satellite dish worry about AT&T tv much cheap get customer home,2
not exactly mean AT&T tv foolproof idea; service still seem lack,2
clear benefit customer differentiate legacy pay tv predecessor competition,2
but style pay tv go continue struggle AT&T least find way save money provide,2
AT&T tv company do that,2
easy sound quite difficult follow buy low sell high idea,2
tough go against collective wisdom investor not like sector stock,2
case energy stock currently down more couple year,2
sustain weakness energy stock price understandably frustrate even most optimistic investor,2
however oil gas supply demand come sync company deliver consistently new environment sector come current price cycle investor interest sector rise,1
admittedly not happen soon,2
contrary effect coronavirus warm weather expect negatively impact oil demand first quarter 2020,2
not good news oil company already post dismal fourth-quarter performance,2
negative near-term outlook pressure energy stock further make more attractive,2
savvy investor recognize opportunity eventually reward,2

fact scale allow make investment commodity price cycle other can not,2
even though ExxonMobil's debt rise bit recently company's leverage conservative,2
Exxonmobil's high production contribute recent investment translate improve top bottom line growth year come,1
Exxon's high investment look like risky bet company's strategy indeed quite sound,2
company make investment hope generate high return divest asset not contribute much cash flow,2
two-pronged approach help ExxonMobil grow earning keep cost under control,2
finally recent fall ExxonMobil's stock price make yield attractive,1
more importantly give company's track record dividend growth well potential free cash flow growth yield look pretty safe,1
ExxonMobil's more 5% yield make up time spend wait stock turn around,2
Conocophillips,2
Conocophillips one US oil gas producer come oil price crisis strong,2
company transform three year 2016 slash dividend,2
generate lot free cash last couple year,2
further intend keep return shareholder,2
ConocoPhillips ability grow cash even current price environment remarkable more other able so,2
single large factor enable ConocoPhillips achieve feat low cost supply,2
significant chunk company's oil gas resource average cost supply less $40 per barrel,1
moreover company add only resource development cost below $40 per barrel,2
strong output Bakken Eagle Ford Permian Basin significantly contribute ConocoPhillips production growth recent year,1
additionally company expect production remain robust 2020,1
continue fuel dividend growth,1
Conocophillips currently offer nearly 3% yield,2
more plenty free cash flow solid long-term growth plan position,2
stock well future irrespective oil price,1
Enbridge,2
Enbridge stock fare better ExxonMobil ConocoPhillips last couple year,1
consistent earning dividend growth even oil price turmoil likely explain Enbridge's superior performance,1
high volume Enbridge's liquid gas pipeline significantly contribute Spectra Energy acquisition drive recent earning growth,1
more Enbridge expect long-term annual per share distributable cash flow growth 5%-7%,1
Enbridge's pipeline secure capital project drive growth,1
consider positive natural gas demand outlook company's increase gas operation follow Spectra Energy acquisition contribute growth,1
Enbridge's strong earning get reflect company's solid dividend growth,1
high earning also help Enbridge bring down debt-to-EBITDA ratio within target range 4.5 time 5 time,1
factor make Enbridge's yield 5.7% attractive,1
