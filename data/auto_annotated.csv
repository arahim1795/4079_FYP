put aside grow pain marijuana industry encounter past year still expect one fastest-grow industry planet next decade,1
though estimate board Wall Street look annual weed sale catapult $10.9 billion 2018 $50 billion $200 billion worldwide annual basis 2030,1
north american pot company aggressively expand capacity investor pile marijuana stock year,2
however not growth marijuana space necessarily same,2
statistic show certain demographic cannabis company go want pay especially close attention to,2
fact one marijuana-use statistic stand head shoulder above rest,2
one cannabis-use statistic nee know,2
July 2019 Gallup release late breakdown regard percentage Americans smoke marijuana,2
consider record-tie 66% Americans want see marijuana legalize United States project large cannabis market world annual sale datum contain within national survey invaluable weed-base company,2
though confidential national usage rate remain fairly steady 2015 2019 (12% 2019) age breakdown usage statistic cannabis ceo really eye,2
break down age 2019 marijuana-use rate United States follow,2
age 18 29: 22%,2
age 30 49: 11%,2
age 50 64: 12%,2
age 65,2
+: 3%,2
one hand no surprise old Americans less likely regular cannabis user,2
senior historically more adverse view cannabis young adult datum provide even more evidence fact,2
but really stand many young adult regularly use marijuana,2
base survey young adult pretty much twice likely millennial,2
Gen X late-bear boomer use cannabis product,2
not only mean young adult future would-be focus marijuana industry but important note young adult also considerably more likely use high-margin derivative edible vape infuse beverage old adult,2
make young consumer important cog future profitability cannabis stock,2
investor want know three derivative-focus marijuana stock,2
no doubt every single marijuana stock throughout North America focus produce number high-margin derivative target burgeon young base consumer trio name want follow especially closely come derivative production,2
view basically no-brainer consider extraction-service company MediPharm Labs Valens Company Neptune Wellness Solutions,2
company take cannabis hemp biomass process yield resin distillate concentrate target cannabinoid use production high-margin derivative,2
not mention extraction-service company may also offer white-label service production thereby reach consumer more direct basis,2
Medipharm Labs Valens solely focus canadian market show similar marijuana-use rate among young adult,2
MediPharm ultimately 500000 kilo peak annual processing capacity Valens aim 1 million kilo per year run-rate basis,2
thing be company begin process hemp cannabis biomass little year ago but already generate no-nonsense profit quarterly basis without aid one-time benefit,1
want more United States-focus processor Neptune Wellness Solutions would well choice,2
acquisition SugarLeaf 2019 Neptune boost peak annual run-rate processing capacity 200000 kilo 1.5 million kilo,2
SugarLeaf's 24000-square-foot facility North Carolina long-term boon Neptune,2
grower provide more direct investment opportunity cannabis space extraction company heart derivative movement movement speak loud young adult,2
yes short-term risk associate derivative pot product,3
one hand little doubt derivative go represent major growth driver north american cannabis company long run young consumer future cannabis industry,2
but not mean not risk short term,2
Canada supply issue have continue be persistent problem,3
since traditional cannabis flower sale commence neighbor north October 17 2018 supply shortage,3
and/or bottleneck ongoing,3
supply problem especially notable Ontario country's most-populous province,3
initially operate retail license lottery system Ontario only open 24 dispensary October 17 2019 one-year anniversary recreational weed sale,2
approximately one store per 604000 people far too province size,2
even change place before sufficient retail channel place throughout Ontario reach consumer,2
meanwhile United States high tax rate select recreationally legal state make virtually impossible legal producer compete black-market product,2
example California large marijuana market world annual sale see cannabis revenue decline $500 million 2018 year,3
adult-use weed sale commence,2
since derivative sport even high price point traditional dry flower gap price black-market product even more pronounced,3
resolution issue north american cannabis industry contend with go take time fix take shape,2
mean patience need investor marijuana company work early stage grow pain,2
none Cronos Group pot stock shiny surge last year,1
may hard believe Cronos Group big all-time winner among canadian marijuana stock especially view last 12 month,1
Cronos lose nearly two-third market cap since February 2019,3
even steep decline though Cronos outperform rival long run,1
brace staggering sum,2
look back,2
before get amount money after buy Cronos stock first important note canadian cannabis producer two different initial listing major stock exchange,2
United States investor probably more familiar Cronos list Nasdaq stock exchange February 2018,2
however Cronos stock available trading before Canada,2
July 2014 PharmaCan conduct IPO TSX Venture Exchange initial share price 0.10 canadian dollar time roughly $0.093 per share,2
PharmaCan change name Cronos Group October 2016,2
buy $1000 worth share would later become Cronos Group 2014 ipo price would able scoop up 10752 share,2
do initial investment would worth $78920,2
legendary investor Peter Lynch use get excited talk 10-baggers reference stock multiply initial investment tenfold,1
Cronos more,2
near-79-bagger,2
time everything,2
turn $1000 nearly $79000 massive achievement,1
make sure sit down,2
sell Cronos day after Altria announcement make December 7 2018 would increase initial investment $136765,2
somehow sense time right instead sell Cronos peak March 5 2019,2
would amass fortune $254822 again off initial investment only $1000,2
sound great,1
suppose miss Cronos initial canadian IPO but opt buy stock,2
story not great,3
instead huge five-figure six-figure gain sit loss buy Cronos Nasdaq debut,3
stock down close 4% since then,3
time everything least come invest marijuana stock,2
more relevant question much money could make invest Cronos Group much money may make buying stock now,2
suspect future fortune hinge timing case too,2
however time not refer buy but instead long plan hold share Cronos,2
good guess Cronos many canadian marijuana stock could rebound 2020,2
industry dynamic improve launch Cannabis 2.0 cannabis derivative market Canada Ontario issue more license new retail cannabis store,2
Cronos could also benefit growth United States hemp CBD market year,2
number may but company also face significant challenge especially fact still lose boatload money every quarter,3
however long term (and talk five year more) global cannabis market expand significantly,2
Cronos relationship Altria give stay power most peer not have,1
not expect $1000 invest Cronos,2
today turn close $79000 within next year,2
but think stock could deliver solid return patient investor willing endure lot volatility,1
tend lump Aurora Cannabis Canopy Growth together top-tier player canadian cannabis industry,1
extent group right,2
Aurora Canopy lead industry production capacity,1
claim high market share canadian adult-use recreational marijuana market,1
but point forward not place Aurora Canopy top tier among canadian cannabis producer,2
two company report late quarterly result last week,2
abundantly clear Canopy Growth different league Aurora,2
yes Aurora report dismal fiscal 2020 Q2 result Canopy Growth announce fiscal 2020 Q3 result much better expect,2
but difference update go beyond number,2
Aurora excuse,2
canopy produce result,2
probably good example relate quarter-over-quarter revenue comparison,2
Aurora's net revenue plunge 26% sequentially,3
Most decline relate company's big adjustment product return price adjustment,3
but Aurora also attribute poor performance part industrywide impact slow pace retail store licensing,3
Contrast Canopy Growth say 62% quarter-over-quarter jump net revenue,1
company single open 140 new store fiscal third quarter key factor behind solid sale growth adult-use recreational market,2
keep mind Aurora Canopy compete market,2
company face headwind,1
however Canopy appear navigate headwind more effectively Aurora be,1
one reason Aurora Cannabis q2 revenue lower stem big mistake make company,3
December Aurora announce german authority temporarily suspend license sell medical cannabis country,3
Problem Aurora use radiation kill microbe cannabis plant without first obtain necessary permit market irradiate cannabis product,2
embarrassing glitch cost company,3
3.2 million canadian dollar (around $2.4 million) second quarter,2
Canopy Growth capitalize Aurora's blunder,1
state,2
medical cannabis sale Germany higher expect,1
due opportunistic sale german market fill,1
supply gap result regulatory enforce sale halt cannabis product offer another vendor,2
Aurora's pain Canopy's gain,2
meanwhile Canopy's strategic acquisition pay off company,2
german cannabinoid company c3 german vaporizer manufacturer Storz & Bickel british skincare sleep solution company work canadian sport nutrition company BioSteel buy Canopy past year contribute organic growth big cannabis producer,1
big differentiator Canopy Growth Aurora Cannabis not new one,2
canopy already big partner alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands,1
Aurora still only hope land major partner,3
gap show up big-time Aurora's Canopy's balance sheet quarterly update,2
Aurora report cash cash equivalent $156.3 million December 31 2019,2
Canopy's cash stockpile total $2.27 billion include cash cash equivalent marketable security,2
hard overstate big advantage relationship Constellation give Canopy,1
huge amount cash,1
obviously important plus,2
but Canopy also access Constellation's distribution network United States marketing hemp-base CBD product,1
Aurora not even presence United States CBD market yet,3
sure Aurora could find partner,2
however not single reference company's effort Q2 conference call,2
probably close thing brief comment interim CEO Executive Chairman Michael Singer Aurora likely look new CEO experience consumer package good industry,2
course Canopy already new CEO CPG experience former Constellation Brands CFO David Klein lead company,2
absolutely. could rebound Germany,2
could achieve success Cannabis 2.0 market,2
could find fantastic new ceo,2
and yes Aurora could even land big partner point,2
however Canopy still claim top market share Canada,1
revenue grow,1
bottom line improve,1
company management team place appear highly competent inspire shareholder confidence,1
Aurora not make claim yet,2
like not several tier canadian marijuana stock,2
reality Canopy Growth top tier right now but Aurora not,2
forget Canada United States big story come cannabis,2
one thing United States cannabis market,2
much big Canada's,2
also more opportunity growth additional state legalize cannabis prospect federal regulatory change would benefit cannabis industry,2
look stock buy capitalize United States cannabis opportunity Charlotte's Web Holdings Green Thumb Industries radar screen,2
case Charlotte's Web holding,2
technically Charlotte's web hemp stock rather marijuana stock,2
distinction worth note since hemp legal federal level United States but marijuana not,2
however Charlotte's web categorize marijuana stock hemp first cousin marijuana difference two level thc cannabis plant,2
Charlotte's web single-handedly launch United States hemp CBD market several year ago,2
leader hemp CBD industry claim number 1 brand total hemp CBD market,1
company deliver strong growth,1
revenue soar 42% year year third quarter,1
Charlotte's web also demonstrate consistent profitability most part although post small loss q3 due high operating expense,2
more importantly though Charlotte's web's growth could accelerate future,2
company's product shelf 9000 retail location more double number begin 2019,2
hemp legalize United States December 2018 hemp CBD market still only early innings,2
perhaps big potential catalyst Charlotte's web possibility federal regulation could change allow use CBD dietary supplement,2
although United States Food Drug Administration take hard line against CBD dietary supplement legislation introduce United States House Representatives bypass FDA revise federal law,2
too soon know bill become law but reason cautiously optimistic,2
encourage Charlotte's web step up game government relation recently hire Kelly Shea newly create position senior vice president government affairs & corporate communication,2
case Green thumb Industries,2
Green Thumb Industries rank one large multistate cannabis operator United States company,2
vertically integrated operating cultivation manufacturing facility marketing cannabis brand wholesale channel run retail cannabis store,2
growth story Green Thumb phenomenal,1
company's revenue soar 296% year year third quarter 2019 jump 52% quarter quarter,1
Green Thumb also deliver positive adjusted earning before interest taxis depreciation amortization,1
growth drive large part Green Thumb's retail expansion,2
early 2019 company operate 14 retail cannabis store,2
recently open 41st store,2
plenty room,2
Green Thumb continue grow,1
company hold 55 additional license open even more retail cannabis store,2
far Green Thumb operation 12 state,2
state include California home big recreational marijuana market Florida home large medical cannabis market,2
Green Thumb also enjoy strong growth home state Illinois recently launch recreational marijuana market,1
remember too Green Thumb achieve success marijuana remain illegal federal level United States federal law change presidential executive order issue legalize marijuana across United States democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders want Green Thumb Industries could even great growth prospect,2
well marijuana stock,1
fan Charlotte's web past,2
however FDA's stance against allow CBD dietary supplement raise concern Charlotte's web's prospect could less hope,3
think good chance,1
United States Congress could sidestep FDA but not slam dunk,2
view green thumb clear path success point,1
although company not profitable yet think right track deliver consistent profit,3
opinion could change hemp CBD officially approve dietary supplement but meantime think Green Thumb Industries better pick,2
