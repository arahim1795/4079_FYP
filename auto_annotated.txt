Conditions oil market remain challenging ever.
continued volatility oil prices playing role, secondary issue sector.
Williams addressed primary problem stating:

time, interpreted evaporation widely held narrative, gauzy conventional wisdom commodity price spike would someday soon lead back more prosperous oil field save all.
Spike not happened, every rally quickly fades industry continues pump more oil global economy needs.
caused sector generate poor investment returns.
result, Williams noted:
Providers external capital oil gas producers service companies exhausted, tired waiting patiently
recovery felt like continued slip horizon.
choked back capital previously pumping operations customers.
capital oil gas oxygen rest .
Petroleum arguably most capital-intensive undertaking industrial enterprises, oil-field services probably second.
Operators react quickly choke off air supply.
pulled back hard capex budgets industry whole, particularly United States, finally seemed resigning fact commodity price spike not going save day old way business not going cut .
Williams points out, industry's air supply cut off, change operates, includes reducing spending.
Most oil companies cut capital investment well below projected cash flow lower oil prices reduce debt return cash investors.
Williams' view, capital starvation, tough right now, planting seeds return prosperity.
forcing industry reduce structural overcapacity, taking actions return industry health.
time, collective actions inevitably lead industry better disciplined pricing shareholder returns.
Rhyming past
Williams painted rather grim picture current state oil industry, ended optimistic note:

However, think recovery emerge no one predicting .
only facts know certain oil industry seen global growth demand almost every single one 160 years industry always highly cyclical.
current time feels awful lot like 1990s then, now, capital providers oil gas fatigued frustrated, another period capital starvation.
then, now, industry responded trimming overcapacity.
History not repeat , but rhyme, encouraged sixth year downturn, oil gas industry

Williams points out, industry's current issues seem parallel experienced 1990s.
period, sector responded structural overcapacity issues trimming excess.
One way series megamergers created most current leaders.
BP started wave August 1998 agreed buy Amoco $48.2 billion deal.
time, largest-ever deal oil patch.
However, Exxon topped later year agreeing acquire Mobil $73.7 billion.
wave continued BP agreed acquire Arco $27 billion 1999, Chevron bought Texaco $45 billion 2000, Conoco merged Phillips Petroleum $35 billion deal 2001.
Merger mania past not repeated, seen parallels
Shell bought BG Group $53 billion 2016
Occidental Petroleum outbid Chevron acquire Anadarko $55 billion last year.
Meanwhile, several smaller oil companies paired up past year.
More consideration seems inevitable, given industry's level overcapacity lack available capital.

Not look back too far find
time Biogen Bristol-Myers Squibb claimed similar market caps.
case spring 2015.
Since then, though, two drugmakers' paths diverged dramatically.
Legitimate reasons investors would want consider buying Biogen Bristol-Myers Squibb right now.
Biogen BMS stack up against other.
Case Biogen
Think three top reasons potentially buy Biogen stock.
Sales spinal muscular atrophy drug continue soar, jumping 16% year year fourth quarter 2019 $543 million.
Worries Novartis' SMA gene therapy Zolgensma might seriously hurt Spinraza largely subsided.
International markets present opportunity sustained sales growth Spinraza.
Until recently, probably not included Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise strong reason consider stock.
biotech's MS sales not given investors anything get excited about.
However, Biogen scored important victory earlier month.
United States Patent Trademark Office's Patent Trial Appeal Board ruled against Mylan's challenge Biogen's key patent MS drug Tecfidera.
Tecfidera is, far, Biogen's biggest-selling drug.
PTAB ruling means Tecfidera likely not generic competition until 2028.
great news
Biogen able count sustained revenue blockbuster MS drug.
But probably most important reason think investing Biogen biotech's pipeline.
After near-death experience experimental Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab, Biogen shocked biopharmaceutical world October announcing planned file FDA approval drug based new clinical data.
definitely not slam dunk aducanumab win FDA approval.
does, though, Biogen almost certainly another future blockbuster lineup.
Biogen pipeline candidates, notably including BIIB067, targets rare form amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ischemic stroke drug BIIB093.
However, aducanumab stands Biogen's lottery ticket could pay off huge way.
Case Bristol-Myers Squibb
BMS, though, not point only one drug one franchise Biogen.
first reason think BMS stock worthy consideration company's entire current lineup.
Market researcher EvaluatePharma crunched numbers last year predict world's biggest blockbusters 2024.
Two BMS' drugs made top five: blood thinner Eliquis cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.
also add arthritis drug Orencia multiple myeloma drug Empliciti list winners BMS' lineup.
Thanks company's recent acquisition Celgene, BMS even more riches.
Blood cancer drug Revlimid ranks one most successful drugs market.
Celgene's multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst solid tumor drug Abraxane also making immediate contributions BMS' growth.
However, think pipeline Celgene brought table second top reason invest BMS.
drugmaker could several potential blockbusters destined FDA approval within next year two, including MS drug ozanimod (which also potential treating Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis)
cancer cell therapies liso-cel ide-cel.
Bms already plenty pipeline programs even before Celgene acquisition.
most promising focus
Opdivo Yervoy treating additional types cancer.
also key reason buy BMS Biogen not claim: great dividend.
view BMS one more attractive dividend stocks market right now, dividend yielding 2.7%.
expectation company able boost dividend payout significantly next years current products pipeline deliver robust earnings growth.
Better buy
Biogen could easily bigger winner
Bristol-Myers Squibb aducanumab wins FDA approval.
However, risk high Alzheimer's disease drug could fail secure approval.
Without aducanumab, Biogen not nearly attractive.
Bms' eggs spread across multiple baskets.
One pipeline setback not devastating.
think late-stage programs BMS picked up Celgene buyout pretty good prospects winning regulatory approval becoming commercial successes.
Income investors, Bristol-Myers Squibb without question better pick since Biogen not offer dividend.
Even growth investors, though, think BMS gets nod growth potential comes lower risk level.
want stock deliver solid total returns allow sleep peacefully night, view go Bristol-Myers Squibb.
A.o.
Smith not household name investors, but maybe after 26 consecutive years dividend increases.
average annual dividend increase last decade roughly 11%, too, solid dividend growth stock.
only problem industrial company facing headwinds one most important global markets: China.
things only getting worse.

Smith not exciting way.

thing is, people developed markets take hot water granted; safe, reliable water heaters still affordable luxury developing markets like China.
Try taking cold shower understand anyone afford water heater buys one.
Many years Smith focused two core markets: North America China.
Today, slow-growing North American market makes up around 64% revenue.
rest comes largely China.
great business
long time country spent vast amounts money building new homes citizens moving rural areas big cities.
Put number that, Smith's China business expanded annualized rate 19% 2009 2018.
huge number helps explain country important company's financial results future.
only thing is, China not great lately A.O. Smith.
Trouble China
Issues started 2018, China's growth began ebb little.
not exactly bad year
A.O. Smith, revenue rest world segment, consists mostly China, up around 5%.
problem earnings division flat.
Things got worse 2019, China's economy started show more serious signs slowing.
Last year, earnings rest world group declined nearly 75%.
fourth quarter 2019, dropped staggering 96%!
terrible measure helps explain stock falling.
However, company hardly sitting idle hoping things get better.
trimming operations rationalizing business, focusing balancing operations China underlying demand seeing.
Smith reported fourth-quarter 2019 earnings, actually sounded relatively upbeat Chinese operations, expecting 2.5% sales jump.
Not exactly screaming win, would huge improvement 2019's results, sales China fell 19% year.
Q4 2019 conference call, CEO Kevin Wheeler commented:
Near term, Chinese economy remains weak.
strong premium brand, broad product offering key product categories, broad distribution reputation quality innovation.
time, well positioned maximize favorable demographics
China India enhance shareholder value.
Said, first quarter expected weak Lunar New Year holiday.
After that, Smith assumed results would start pick up.
Only coronavirus cropped up issue steadily growing intensity, effectively shutting down entire regions China.
A.O. Smith's conference call, basically admitted COVID-19 outbreak wildcard:
2020 EPS guidance excludes potential impact businesses developing coronavirus originating China.
Although clearly too soon tell bad be, answer
A.O. Smith's Chinese operations 2020 probably perform worse originally expected.
not good news, since company finally gotten handle business region following two difficult years.
saving grace here, however, nearly two-thirds sales company come
developed markets slow steady growth rate driven well-worn replacement cycle.
China could clip earnings, but not completely derail .
Furthermore, company's balance sheet provides firm foundation weather storm.
put numbers that, Smith's debt-to-equity ratio ultralow 0.05 so.
covers interest expenses incredibly strong 43 times.
payout ratio 40%.
payout ratio up recent past earnings down 2019, hardly concerning figure.
company clearly deal headwinds facing.
Another tough year
Point, investors probably expect 2020 rough year
A.O. Smith's rest world segment, largely made up Chinese operations.
means company's forecast 2020 could bit too rosy point might get dialed back year progresses.
said, lot bad news already priced stock.
2.2% dividend yield not terribly compelling absolute basis, higher decade.
Dividend growth investors probably take closer look company today investors running scared.
Even 2020 another tough year, company no trouble surviving itand thriving headwinds fade away.
