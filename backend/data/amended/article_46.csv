whether think Alphabet's stock expensive cheap much cheap probably think,
why: ton cash balance sheet moonshot business bet segment lose billion (but not last forever) several big growth business huge long-term potential but appear barely contribute profit today,
cash rich balance sheet,
alphabet enormously cash-rich balance sheet little debt,
end last year Alphabet,
$18 billion cash cash equivalent $101 billion marketable security $13 billion non-marketable investment balance sheet,
almost $133 billion cash investment,
look company's liability less $5 billion long-term debt book,
give Alphabet highly profitable generate gobs cash $128 billion net cash clearly excess capital not require operate business,
therefore investor focus less current stock price more stock price exclude company's net cash investment per share,
example Alphabet's Class C share trade $1509 per share today but include $187 per share net cash investment,
mean business  exclude cash really trade closer $1322 per share,
bet loss not last forever,
look under hood Alphabet's income statement net income combination huge profit core Google business partially offset big loss moonshot project,
bet segment,
example last quarter Google segment make $11 billion operate income bet segment lose $2 billion,
but important understand distinction,
Google's operating profit recur nature; fact grow long term,
bet loss different,
venture capital-like investment not recur operating loss,
word business within bet either reach profitability start contribute positively shut down sell,
management not go tolerate billion loss,
bet segment forever,
especially true,
give CEO's new compensation arrangement tie pay stock price performance next two three year,
make sense exclude Bets loss consider profitable Alphabet be especially light great discipline management bring bet reduce loss go forward,
several fast grow business barely chip,
several Alphabet's fast grow business not appear chip much profit yet,
mean company's report profit today way low could future,
consider Google Cloud Platform,
management not explicitly disclose GCP's profitability but last conference call strongly suggest GCP's current profit margin low perhaps even negative,
ask whether GCP profitable Amazon's Amazon Web Services size GCP,
today Alphabet's CFO Ruth Porat say,
term margin question look think view be obviously competitive dynamic cloud market different today,
invest aggressively give opportunity try make clear opening comment,
give opportunity see momentum have accelerate investment go-to-market team,
talk before set goal triple size sale force,
also focus building product road map extend global footprint infrastructure,
words cloud market much more competitive today,
AWS Microsoft Azure GCP,
several year ago AWS size GCP today,
back then AWS essentially market  not worry much competitive pricing pressure therefore high profit margin GCP today,
plus repeat emphasis GCP's aggressive investment spending clear signal GCP's current profit minimal,
consider YouTube global leader user-generate video content,
conference call Porat say continue build subscription service still early day there make sizable investment build out take long-term view here,
time management team emphasize early day invest code current profit margin low,
finally consider company's hardware business,
Porat say invest heavily develop capability hardware engineering well build supply physical distribution chain,
again mean current profit low,
Summary Alphabet's normalize level earning much high today's earning investor realize management minimize Bets loss eventually shift gear focus more harvesting profit business,
Alphabet way cheap most investor think,
