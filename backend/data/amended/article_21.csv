big pharma outstanding space investor past five year,
fact every single big pharma company outperform broad biopharmaceutical industry period term total return capital include dividend assume dividend reinvestment plan,
top dog industry crush broad market past-half decade result major structural change internal operation,
well strong focus develop truly innovative new product cancer rare disease infectious disease,
Glaxosmithkline Bristol-Myers Squibb forefront industrywide metamorphosis,
Glaxo process spin off consumer healthcare joint venture Pfizer british pharma giant also place heavy emphasis clinical development cutting-edge cancer drug late,
Bristol hand recently bulk up acquire top cancer immunology specialist Celgene,
two big pharma enter new phase respective life cycle arguably perfect time consider stock well long-term prospect,
case Glaxo,
Glaxo currently pass period major change,
pharma titan presently gear up hive off non-core business segment consumer healthcare,
possibly dermatology business,
well,
so Glaxo intend place strong spotlight bevy growth asset respiratory oncology HIV vaccine,
another key element ongoe metamorphosis drugmaker's renew focus next-generation technology like functional genomic speed up process drug discovery development,
thus Glaxo slowly but surely move toward become leaner more efficient biopharma-centric company,
encourage development follow Glaxo's less-than-stellar showing prior decade rather dark period company's history characterize bribery scandal numerous clinical failure inability move invest narrative beyond eventual decline megablockbuster respiratory medicine Advair,
Pfizer Glaxo yet agree timeline official launch consumer healthcare business standalone unit seminal event take place no later 2024,
part seismic shift company's underlie business Glaxo plan continue divest certain noncore asset offset cost associate upcome consumer healthcare spinoff presumably assuage regulator United States EU,
direct consequence spinoff,
Glaxo seem poise remain fairly dormant merger-and-acquisition scene next year,
drugmaker may strike more partnering deal similar oncology alliance Merck KGaA but another high-dollar acquisition vein Tesaro buyout probably off table until spinoff complete,
after all Glaxo probably not take much more debt without severe consequence credit rating,
company fact currently sport one most highly lever balance sheet among big-pharma peer group,
turn Glaxo's primary value creator next year probably clinical pipeline,
fortunately company's r&d engine turn source strength under new leadership team several major regulatory decision oncology HIV respiratory medicine among other slate take place later year,
heavy reliance experimental-stage asset future growth one major downside however,
short no realistic way accurately forecast drugmaker's top-line growth next three five year,
unfortunately Wall Street rarely comfortable high level uncertainity revenue side equation especially come industry megagiant like Glaxo,
case Bristol,
Bristol's acquisition biotech heavyweight Celgene prove game-changer company,
underscore point big pharma's late quarterly result absolutely clobber Wall Street's expectation Celgene's high-growth product portfolio,
look ahead recent megamerger continue pay dividend big pharma two clear-cut reason,
first foremost Bristol sport whopping eight blockbuster product after tie-up,
moreover powerhouse immunotherapy Opdivo no longer bulk heavy lifting growth standpoint,
key Opdivo's sale start taper off lately,
fact may never regain status top-tier growth product fierce competition,
Merck's Keytruda well host immunotherapy,
second Bristol's clinical pipeline get major injection talent Celgene acquisition,
near future company expect gain several regulatory approval potential blockbuster like blood disorder treatment Reblozyl well anti-cancer cell therapy,
bb2121 liso-cel,
so anything Bristol's growth engine only continue pick up steam year ahead,
one major drawback associate megamerger,
Bristol's balance sheet highly levered result deal,
now big pharma planning reduce debt big way year,
so though may miss value-create M&A opportunity,
not end world sure but always,
good thing flexibility come business development opportunity,
verdict,
although company could turn outstanding long-term invest vehicle Bristol's stock stand better pick right now,
Glaxo's shape-shift endeavor yet take solid form whereas Bristol sit,
pretty thank decision go big acquire Celgene last year,
Bristol thus come across low-risk high-reward invest vehicle thing stand now,
not exactly say Glaxo stage game,
