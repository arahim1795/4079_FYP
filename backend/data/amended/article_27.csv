cut-edge technology gene-edit cancer immunology tend get lot attention biotech world one most lucrative niche area come treat relatively common condition,
diabetes quickly become one most prevalent disease world,
right now 425 million people around world living condition estimate suggest number grow 629 million 2045,
one promising diabetes stock Insulet well-know manufacturer insulin pump,
couple noteworthy player market Insulet impress investor analyst alike consistent impressive growth figure,
insulin pump,
understand market,
insulin pump help diabetes patient regulate blood sugar level provide consistent dose insulin throughout day,
Most diabetes patient not currently use insulin pump but give convenience factor expect many patient begin use year come,
around 350000 people United States use insulin pump; 320000 type 1 diabetes remainder type 2,
consider severity type 1 diabetes patient whose pancreas incapable produce insulin make sense majority early adopter pump fall category,
however type 2 diabetes patient also use pump,
350000 user may not seem like massive number right now number patient use device expect explode come year,
2018 global insulin pump market estimate around $4.1 billion but 2025 predict grow $16 billion per year,
among reason pretty big convenience factor come use pump,
instead patient inject multiple time per day insulin pump low maintenance job,
Insulet one three major competitor insulin pump market; two company Medtronic Tandem Diabetes care,
Insulet know OmniPod system top tubeless insulin pump available right now,
OmniPod waterproof discreet wear under clothing,
Tandem diabetes t: slim X2 insulin pump not waterproof require tube much more conspicuous least now OmniPod able distinguish competitor,
big problem OmniPod not feature continuous glucose monitoring system like t,
slim do,
Dexcom's CGM system consider top system kind,
insulet planning launch OmniPod Horizon system later 2020 incorporate Dexcom monitor automate insulin dose patient,
look financial,
truly impressive Insulet growth past year,
company's most recent q3 2019 financial result revenue up 27% last year grow $151.1 million $192.1 million,
look back 2017 sale come around $121.8 million income 2016 $94.9 million,
strong trend revenue growth impressive show little sign slow down,
actual profit though less striking,
net income most recent quarter $900000 whereas last year see net income $1.7 million,
common high-growth company,
Insulet focus more growth rather profit investor keep mind stock barely break even despite growth,
tandem less half size,
insulet grow much fast rate,
sale shoot up 105% q3 2019 $94.7 million Tandem report net loss $2.9 million significant improvement $34.2 million loss see previous year,
company Market cap Quarterly revenue growth rate net profit price-to-sale ratio,
Insulet $12.7 billion $192.1 million 27%,
$0.9 million 18.7 Tandem Diabetes $4.9 billion $94.7 million 105% ($2.9 million) 14.8,
Medtronic $156.3 billion $7.7 billion 4.1% $1.4 billion 5.1,
despite grow slow rate Tandem Insulet trade pricy premium,
only major player insulin pump market Medtronic much large either Tandem Insulet command market cap,
however Medtronic's price-to-sale ratio 5.1 substantially cheap either two competitor (although revenue grow much small pace far perfect comparison),
point here Insulet definitely pricy side comparison competitor not immediately clear justify premium,
Insulet technically profitable also grow slow rival something much more important high-growth company young market,
reality insulin pump market plenty room grow main player sector expect growth rate stay strong quite time include Insulet,
account company bright future ahead,
however compare competitor may not good insulin pump / diabetes stock market right now,
force pick one stock market,
not sure Insulet would,
however not say Insulet bad company mean: strong growth competitive product promise market make biotech stock buy book,
