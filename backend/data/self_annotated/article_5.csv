let start acknowledge predict stock industry deliver good performance next decade crapshoot,2
take whatever odd against,2
successfully probably double triple come pick biotech stock,2
deliver high return,1
simply too many variable play biotech world,2
clinical trial flop,3
prospect regulatory approval evaporate thin air,3
rival launch well drug,3
but factor look help improve chance choose biotech stock likely succeed next 10 year,2
look company's lead pipeline candidate well early-stage long-shot candidate,2
look market potential indication pipeline drug target,2
evaluate risk company face,2
top three pick,2
Vertex Pharmaceuticals,2
biotech clear path deliver strong revenue earning growth Vertex Pharmaceuticals,1
company dominate cystic fibrosis market four FDA-approve drug,1
sale couple drug,2
Orkambi Symdeko,2
sure increase significantly next year,1
thanks reimbursement deal recently sign important european market,2
Vertex's new cf drug Trikafta not european regulatory approval yet but think really safe bet will,2
assume right drug expand biotech's addressable cf patient population more 50%,2
no potential rival even close far along Vertex be,1
say Vertex clear path strong revenue earning growth,1
base CF franchise alone,2
fully expect Vertex also drug market within next decade treat disease cf,2
company's pipeline include experimental drug target pain several rare genetic disease,2
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency apol1 mediate kidney disease,2
Vertex work CRISPR Therapeutics develop gene-editing therapy target rare blood disease beta-thalassemia sickle cell disease,2
Vertex's swing fence,2
company acquire Semma Therapeutics last year scoop up Semma's program focus curing type 1 diabetes,2
Vertex develop safe effective cure,2
t1d tremendous success CF could pale comparison lie ahead,1
Bluebird bio,2
until recently bluebird bio not approve product market,1
change biotech's January launch Germany Zynteglo gene therapy target treatment transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia follow secure european approval June 2019,2
Zynteglo not approve United States yet but Bluebird expect file FDA approval first half year,2
company also plan evaluate Zynteglo phase 2/3 clinical study target sickle cell disease,2
another gene therapy late-stage test Lenti-D treat rare genetic disease cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,2
especially like prospect Bluebird's experimental multiple myeloma drug ide-cel bb21217,2
drug license Celgene acquire Bristol-Myers Squibb November 2019 blockbuster sale potential,2
Bluebird's market cap currently stand around $5 billion level give plenty room run view,1

Editas Medicine,2
admit step limb pick,2
Editas Medicine's lead pipeline candidate EDIT-101 only early-stage clinical testing treatment Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 lead genetic cause blindness,2
edita license right edit-101,2
Allergan small biotech not make revenue gene-editing therapy may generate eventually approve,2
but edita chip not ride edit-101,2
Editas Allergan take similar approach edit-102 treat another genetic eye disease Usher syndrome type 2a take edit-101,2
like Vertex CRISPR Therapeutics Editas also develop CRISPR gene-editing therapy target beta-thalassemia sickle cell disease,2
edita hope file FDA approval later year begin clinical testing therapy,2
company's approach editing HBG1 HBG2 gene could more effective CRISPR Therapeutics approach editing bcl11ae gene,2
rationale choose edita though CRISPR gene-editing platform hold promise treat wide range disease,2
biotech work Bristol-Myers Squibb develop off-the-shelf cell therapy target cancer well develop fully own cancer cell therapy,2
gene-editing approach successful treat eye disease company think could potentially target heart liver neuromuscular nervous system disease too,2
