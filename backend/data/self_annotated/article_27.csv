despite grow slow rate Tandem Insulet trade pricy premium,3
only major player insulin pump market Medtronic much large either Tandem Insulet command market cap,2
however Medtronic's price-to-sale ratio 5.1 substantially cheap either two competitor (although revenue grow much small pace far perfect comparison),1
