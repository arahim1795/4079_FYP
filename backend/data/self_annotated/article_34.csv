everyone seem hate oil company today one reason many offer dividend big fat yield,1
problem real reason worry energy stock bankruptcy pick up particularly onshore United States oil space,3
but oil company not create equal,3
better build weather up down highly cyclical industry,2
three high-yield oil stock prove take survive keep pay generous dividend intrepid investor willing buy hold other grow skittish,2
exxonmobil: big spender,2
Exxonmobil probably one most-hate integrated oil natural gas giant world massive size,2
though ESG investor push hard convince energy company's management change course decide double down oil drilling,1
unapologetic plan spend much $35 billion year capital project like expand onshore United States oil production drilling water around Guyana,2
fact next year Exxon likely see production head higher after year contraction,1
not capital spending however direct toward drilling,2
company also invest downstream operation boost refining petrochemical manufacturing capability,2
notable Exxon diversify across energy sector,1
give portfolio more balance though right now even downstream operation perform well tough environment,1
thing be Exxon build like tank handle heavy spend weak business environment,1
example debt-to-equity ratio around 0.15 put low end peer group and frankly low range company industry,1
add dividend increase annually 37 consecutive year currently yield 5.8% toward high end historical range see contrarian investor investigate stock today,1
Chevron,2
hold back little bit,2
perhaps Exxon's decision double down oil drilling little too much,3
case may want look peer United States,2
energy giant Chevron.  too one large most diversified energy company Earth,1
but unlike Exxon decide more conservative capital spending plan earmark only $20 billion toward,2
relative cash flow operation low level peer group,1
say Chevron benefit previous spending production still grow right now,1
thus hardly give up oil fall behind peer (like Exxon major effort underway onshore United States oil space),1
big difference Chevron way invest energy sector without accept risk inherent big investment Exxon make,1
Chevron meanwhile also extremely attractive look dividend history dividend yield balance sheet,1
company increase payout annually 32 year,1
yield currently robust 4.7%,1
and like Exxon debt-to-equity ratio sit near low end industry roughly 0.15,1
Chevron's balance sheet build like rock company take current oil downturn stride,1
total S.A.: dip toe new water,2
France's Total S.A. bit different Exxon Chevron,2
starter debt-to-equity ratio,2
around 0.45 but manageable amount leverage energy giant,2
fact company long operate more debt United States counterpart,3
meanwhile not increase dividend quite regularly but payout generally trend high recent year,1
(note total foreign company dividend United States investor receive fluctuate along relative valuation euro dollar.),2
say roughly 5.9% yield high trio,1
but really big difference total start invest outside oil natural gas space,2
fact 2018 pay roughly $1.8 billion buy european electric utility,1
one many effort total make diversify away carbon-base energy business,2
also put money work renewable power generation space invest electric-vehicle charge operation among thing,2
Fair Total still primarily oil gas company,2
not plan drastic overnight change,2
more use core operation foundation position clean-energy future,1
sound like well path Exxon Chevron take,2
well serve take close look total right now,2
buy other sell,2
oil industry executive clear future oil not go away,2
energy source anytime soon still high demand,2
put simply oil continue play integral role world,2
current price weakness par course commodity know volatility,3
Exxon Chevron Total build deal up down continue pay investor well stick around,1
global giant however take slightly different approach,2
like buy other sell good time look trio,2
nee select one whose strategy best reflect long-term view world's energy future,2
